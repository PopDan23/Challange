**This is my Deeptech Engineer Intern Challenges**

This will serve as a test to see how i can actually investigate new things and adapt to them. It might now work as intended, but will do my best.

## Challenge #1
Address Extraction
Address Extraction
Write a program that extracts all the valid addresses that are found on a list of company websites. The format in which you will have to extract this data is the following: country, region, city, postcode, road, and road numbers

Explore this from as many different angles as you can. It will generate valuable questions. We are also interested in your explanations, reasoning and decision-making along with the actual output. 

## Challenge #1
**Guidelines**

- Check whether the program correctly extracts the country, region, city, postcode, road, and road numbers from every page of every website.
- From a tech stack perspective, you can use any programming language, toolset or libraries you're comfortable with or find necessary, especially if you know it will be better or more interesting (we generally prefer Node, Python, Scala).
